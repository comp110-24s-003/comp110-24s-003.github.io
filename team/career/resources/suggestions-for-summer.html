It may feel a little early to be thinking about recruiting for next summer when the current summer isnâ€™t even over, but these suggestions have benefits beyond recruiting (though that is the main focus here). Doing some of that work over the summer will help with getting a more systematic approach when it comes to job searching in the future. If you feel up for it, set a goal of a few interview practice problems to do each week (or even just one thing to practice per week). You wonâ€™t feel crammed on time and stuff to learn once interviews start up if youâ€™ve been practicing for a while. That said, doing that might not be the most appealing summer plan so here are some less stressful and hopefully more interesting things you can do instead (or in addition to that!).</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up-spring-semester">Wrap Up Spring Semester</h2>
<p>At the end of a semester, itâ€™s good to do a little recap of what happened. Update your GPA on your resume (if you have it on there) and think about what you accomplished. If you have your classes listed somewhere, think about whether that needs to be updated too. The last big thing here comes down to projects. If you did any significant projects or projects that you are proud of and interested in, whether for class or on your own, consider adding those to your resume as well! Be careful about adding course-related projects to your GitHub even if the semester has ended though (itâ€™s worth checking with the professor of the course you did the project for before uploading your work). Another thing to think about is the projects you enjoyed doing for school â€” if you can think of ways to extend them beyond what was required for your course, thatâ€™s a great way to keep those skills sharp over the summer and itâ€™s also a great thing to have as a talking point on your resume or in interviews. Plus, since you wouldâ€™ve already done work on the project during school you have an idea of how to structure it so you donâ€™t have to figure everything out on your own from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="explore-things-you-find-interesting">Explore Things You Find Interesting</h2>
<p>Summer is a good time to pay attention to what you want to learn and not just what youâ€™re required to learn for school. It doesnâ€™t have to be a huge deal or take up all your time, but it can be cool to find something youâ€™re curious about and see what you can find out about it. There are lots of good tutorials, videos, and blog posts about pretty much every topic out there, and those are things you can do at your own pace on your own time. Like everything else here, this is an extra little thing you can add to your summer that can show future employers more about you. Itâ€™s also a good time to get a look into different things to see if you have any undiscovered interests that youâ€™d want to take a class on or look more deeply into later. And again, GitHub is a good tool for staying organized with your work and keeping track of the projects youâ€™ve done (if you do follow someone elseâ€™s guide to a project, it can be good to note that in your repo if you make one on GitHub for people who might look at it later and also for your future self if you ever want to come back to look at what you did once youâ€™ve forgotten details).</p>
<h2 id="think-about-what-you-want">Think About What You Want</h2>
<p>Summerâ€™s a good time to do some real thinking about what you want to try or do in a future job. Itâ€™s right before fall recruiting season and itâ€™s a time when you can probably take a break from being surrounded by other peopleâ€™s opinions and goals which can be surprisingly influential when everyoneâ€™s at school together. So, while youâ€™re going about your summer keep in mind what you like to do and if you come across companies you think it might be cool to work for, make note of them somewhere. Building up a list, even if itâ€™s not at all your main focus, can give you ideas of where to apply once recruiting kicks in. You can even decide to do the background research for the companies later, but it can be nice going into recruiting with an idea of what you want. As an extra you can set alerts for those companies when they have new job/internship postings or try to find their application deadlines, but this information isnâ€™t always available all summer and it wonâ€™t get you too far ahead to do that step of research super early anyway.</p>
<h2 id="keep-track-of-what-you-do">Keep Track of What You Do</h2>
<p>If you decide to do any personal projects or try to learn a new skill during your summer, keep track of this somewhere! Write down how itâ€™s going, resources youâ€™re using, or things youâ€™re doing. The same applies to if youâ€™re doing an internship or research or another type of job â€” keep track of what you learn and do for that too. It doesnâ€™t have to be super in-depth or an exact account of every single thing, but having something will be hugely helpful during fall (or spring) recruiting. At the end of the day, when school starts again and youâ€™re busy with other stuff it wonâ€™t be super easy to remember all you did over the summer. Having notes or highlights of what you did will be really nice to refer back to before interviews since what you do over the summer (no matter what that is) can often be an interview subject, so doing this during your summer will leave you in less of a bind when it becomes important to know again in the future.</p>
