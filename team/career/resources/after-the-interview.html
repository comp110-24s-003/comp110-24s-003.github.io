Below is more information about how and why to do this.</p>
<h2 id="interview-notes">Interview Notes</h2>
<p>This is a hard habit to get into, but it can be very beneficial. When putting an interview on your schedule, leave an extra ~30 minutes afterward for unwinding and reviewing the experience. Specifically, take note of these aspects of the interview (to the extent that you can remember):</p>
<ul>
<li>High-level topics the interviewer covered</li>
<li>Specific questions the interviewer asked</li>
<li>Your answers to these questions</li>
<li>What went well</li>
<li>What didn‚Äôt go well</li>
<li>Your impressions of the interviewer and any details about the company that came up (interviews are also a chance for you to get a sense of whether a company would be good for you and what you want)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a lot, but it‚Äôs worth it. Interviews are taxing, so it‚Äôs totally fine if you don‚Äôt remember everything. But what you do remember, write down on a fresh page in your recruiting notebook/binder/folder (bonus points for noting the company, interviewer, role, and date).</p>
<p>The especially hard part is the ‚Äúwhat didn‚Äôt go well‚Äù section ‚Äî it‚Äôs not the most exciting thing to relive the details of an interview you feel like you just bombed, but the extra 30 minutes you give yourself are there for this purpose. Even though it‚Äôs uncomfortable, if you use this time to be completely honest with yourself about how things went and how you could‚Äôve handled things better when they didn‚Äôt go well, you will learn a lot from it.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve done this hard part, you‚Äôre done! After all this reflection, let yourself move on (this advice applies especially to interviews that don‚Äôt go so well ‚Äî you worked hard, made it out alive, and learned from it, which means it was a success). Treat yourself to something that makes you happy and take a real break, even if it‚Äôs short ‚Äî no matter how the interview went, you deserve it.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, you can learn a lot from every interview, whether it went well or not so well. Forcing yourself to focus on how it went immediately after the fact is good since the longer you wait the more you forget, and its additional benefits are two-fold: you can be more confident about what went well and things you had fun with in the interview, and you can give yourself some constructive feedback into what should get more focus next time you practice. Also, knocking that out while it‚Äôs still fresh in your mind means you don‚Äôt have to drag it out or dwell on it any more!</p>
<p>The other nice thing about writing all this down and keeping it in one place is that you‚Äôll build up a record of the processes you go through. You‚Äôre giving your future self more resources and personalized feedback to review the next time you have an interview coming up. It‚Äôs an extra nice bonus if you happen to interview with the same company again later, since you‚Äôll be able to look back on what their specific process is like. It‚Äôs also cool to see all the work you put in and how you change and improve over time!</p>
